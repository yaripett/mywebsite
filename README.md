<h2> About Me</h2>
<p> My name is Yari Pettis, a motivated and forward-thinking computer science major at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, currently holding a 3.393 GPA. I am passionate about the intersection of technology and ethics, which led me to present my research on the ethical use of artificial intelligence at Yale Universityâ€”an experience that deepened my interest in responsible innovation. My academic journey includes a strong foundation in programming, calculus, and engineering principles, supported by a history of rigorous coursework such as AP Statistics and dual enrollment in English and Spanish. In addition to placing 3rd in the Fall 2024 NCAT Hackathon, I earned 2nd place in the Spring 2025 edition, further affirming my technical growth and problem-solving capabilities.

This summer, I am serving as a research assistant, gaining hands-on experience in collaborative, real-world investigations related to computing and AI. My skill set includes certifications in HTML from W3Schools, proficiency in Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office, and intermediate Spanish. I have also developed strong communication and teamwork abilities through academic and extracurricular activities, including leadership roles in Future Business Leaders of America and athletic participation in varsity football and track. With a commitment to innovation, ethics, and continual learning, I am excited to contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge research and future tech-driven solutions.
